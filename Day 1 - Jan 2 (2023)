# Started Compiler Design 

## Completed intro part and Lexical Analysis.
- Important things to be noted in this are phases of compiler, their functionality, and the outputs they produce. Symbol table, error checking and error recovery in Lexical Analysis.
- In Lexical Analysis (O/p -> Stream of tokens), Possible Questions are --
- 1) tokens counting
- 2) Grammar (V,T,P,S)
- 3) Checking grammar is ambiguous or not
- 4) Reasons for ambiguity happens due to 2 factors: a) Precedence 
                                                     b) Associativity
- 5) Eliminating the ambiguity by checking whether it left recursive or right recursive.
- 6) Levels :: lower-most level -> Higher Precedence ; higher-most leve -> Lower Precedence.
- 7) Left Recursive :: If MSB of RHS of the given Production rules is same as LHS.
     Right Recursive :: If LSB of RHS of the given Production rules is same as LHS.
