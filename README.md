# Cracking-Gate-CS-in-1-month
Here I will update my every day journey for Gate prep and topics I have completed, practiced for Cracking Gate CS 2023

## My Learning Approach:
- As I hardly have 1 month, I'm trying to go through the Syllabus in a faster and an efficient way so that I can solve the gate questions.
- step 1 : For Theoretical part -> reading, understanding and noting down few important points.
- step 2 : For Practical part -> going through lectures and solving examples.
- step 3 : Pyq's and other questions from few test series and question banks.
- step 4 : Revising (Basic go through)
- Doing step 1 and step 2 Parallely whenever needed.
- Once done with few chapters doing the step 3.
- Trying to cover 2 chapters from atmost 3 subjects/day (To maintain efficiency and broader coverage).
- step 4 at the end of the day.
- Repeating these until I'm done with the subject.
- Note: I'm trying to cover all the subjects in Breadth and Max. possible depth I can do in 1 month.
